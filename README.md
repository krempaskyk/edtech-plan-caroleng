# Educational Technology Plan

{Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan}

This Educational Technology Plan is prepared to ensure that Santa Teresa High School will know what the minimum technical requirements are for the APCS-Principles class.

## Context

### Course  APCS-Principles

{Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level}

Grade: 9 - 12

"AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical." -- CollegeBoard

### Situation

{Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?}

{In addition to describing the course, provide pertinant details about the situation in which you will be teaching it. If you know information like class size, student demographics, classroom/school technologies available, etc., summarize it here. If you are not yet a teacher or want to keep the plan broad to potentially adopt in different situations, provide a summary of the assumptions you are making, such as approximate class size, grade levels, and technology available.}

Santa Teresa High School is one of eleven high schools in the Eastside Union High School District.  In 2013, we started teaching Exploring CS.  In 2015, we added APCS-A (Java).  We did not participate in APCS-P in 2017 when it first came out, and we started teaching APCS-P in 2018.

CS has become popular in our school, and at the moment, we have eight CS classes.  We currently has only one computer lab, and the other three classes are taught in the library's computer lab, which is not a proper classroom.  With its growth rate, within the next two years, we will have ten CS classes.  This calls for having two computer labs.  This means more hardware (computers, Android devices), software licenses, and more demand from the network for efficient Internet speed.

## Plan

{In the plan, you will specify what technologies both you and your students will use.}

### Software Specifications

{Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.}

{Within the Software subsection, describe all software you (and your students) will use including operating system(s), learning management systems, required installed software, as well as any online/web services. For example, for this class, I would list a variety of operating systems (including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux), Blackboard LMS, GitHub.com, and the video recording/editing software I use (OBS and iMovie).}

1. Courseware

   We use mobile-CSP, and the courseware is supplied in Runestone.

   The student version is in https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp.

   The teacher version is in https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/teach-mobilecsp

   mobile-CSP uses MIT's App Inventor.  This is an app totally run on the web.  We use this for our coding exercises.

2. Assessment software

   Our district provides us with IlluminteEd.

   I sometimes use Kahoot just to have some fun.

3. Reference software

    There are many sites with free APCS-P software which we can use as reference:

    code.org
    projectSTEM.org

4.  Classroom aids 

    Google Classroom



The Clevertouch is a fine example of what interactive whiteboards can do in the classroom. Each one comes with an intuitive interface (called LUX) that is modeled after the interface found on Android devices. Students, therefore, are quick studies when it comes to the Clevertouch. With the Clevertouch, teachers can build lessons using graphic and media assets, reducing lesson creation time greatly. Teachers can also model math and physics principles using Clevermaths and turn the Clevertouch into a multi-zone lesson delivery device with Snowflake. This, along with the Clevertouch’s extensive device connectivity capabilities, allows for true multi-user collaboration between students.

And classroom aid technology comes with proprietary software designed to improve the technology’s function. Again, the Clevertouch is a strong example of how this merge of hardware and software can pay massive dividends for educators. Through the Clevertouch, educators can access the Cleverstore, which isn’t so much a store as it is a massive bank of educational applications. All in-app purchases have been removed and all content unlocked, so the Clevertouch can be augmented in a major way with smart use of the Cleverstore.



### Hardware Specifications

{Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.}

{Also describe if/how they are network connected (i.e. ethernet vs wifi, along with any known limitations like blocked WWW access). Describe any other relevant technology as well, such as projectors, smart boards, etc.}

1.  Course

While I understand that chromebooks are probably good enough for the purpose of running this course, I would like to recommend PC laptops.  I am hoping that my students will be doing more challenging projects that require the power of a "real" PC.  The minimum requirements will be:
- Intel i7 processor
- 16 GB RAM 
- 64-bit operating system
- Windows 10 
- **no** touch type

Android device (phone or tablet) with minimum requirements:
- 4 GB RAM
- 8 GB storge
- Android operating system
- GPS
- Accelerometer
- Camera

Why **Android**?  We use mobilecsp, which uses App Inventor to write apps.  The MIT's team has tried to make App Inventor works for both Android and iOS.  The Android OS has beework with Apple to make App Inventor works for iOS, but every time when Apple update the iOS version, App Inventor will stop working.

2. Classroom Aid

An overhead projector in the classroom is a must.  Teachers need to show students what to do, and students need to be able to see the projection no matter where they sit.

###  Network Specifications

{Describe network and communication devices/infrastructure involved in your plan.}

The computers need gigabit ethernet connectivity and the Android devices need wireless connectivity.

### Application

{Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.}

{After listing the technical details of the plan, you will explain how you will use the technology in the Application subsection. For example, in a programming course, you will explain that students will use their IDE (which should be listed in the software) to code and run their programs but you will also describe how they will turn in the assignments and how you will grade them and give students feedback. This is also where you will describe any of the evidence-based practices you plan to adopt and how technology will support them (e.g. describing how you will apply the coherence principle to designing PowerPoint presentation slides that will be projected for lessons, and how students will share their computers to practice pair programming), as discussed in the modules on eLearning Principles and Computing Practices & Pedagogy.}

### Impacts

{How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.}

{Finally, in the final version, you will discuss the Impacts of your plan. Here, you can justify your choices in how you expect it to help students' learning. Explain how you have catered your plan to your course and context. This is also where you can describe any contigency plans you have, such as if you have to transition to  from in-person to virtually teaching.}
