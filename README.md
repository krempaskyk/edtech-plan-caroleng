# Educational Technology Plan

[Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan]

This Educational Technology Plan is prepared to ensure that Santa Teresa High School will know what the minimum technical requirements are for the APCS-Principles class.

## Context

### Course  APCS-Principles

[Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level]

Grade: 9 - 12

"AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical." -- CollegeBoard

### Situation

[Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?]

Santa Teresa High School is one of eleven high schools in the Eastside Union High School District.  In 2013, we started teaching Exploring CS.  In 2015, we added APCS-A (Java).  We did not participate in APCS-P in 2017 when it first came out, and we started teaching APCS-P in 2018.

CS has become popular in our school, and at the moment, we have eight CS classes.  We currently has only one computer lab, and the other three classes are taught in the library's computer lab, which is not a proper classroom.  With its growth rate, within the next two years, we will have ten CS classes.  This calls for having two computer labs.  This means more hardware (computers, Android devices), software licenses, and more demand from the network for efficient Internet speed.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

[Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.]

1. Courseware – A portmanteau of coursework and software, courseware is, by far, the most common type of educational software available. Courseware has been around as long as computer labs have been set aside for student use. They include any software that is designed to instruct the student, and can come in the form of a teacher kit or a tutorial for students. So, both kindergarten art programs and companion software linked to a physics lab course are considered courseware, by this definition.

Courseware has been improved and expanded upon profoundly in just a couple decades, and some courseware can teach entire subjects with excellent precision. The idea of what courseware could be has also been stretched, as it now includes software delivered online.

But when software development companies refer to courseware, they are often describing a single course (of any subject) bundled with assessment materials and supplemental lessons.

No matter the definition, though, courseware is the backbone of any educator’s software suite.

2. Assessment software – In an effort to reduce paper waste and the logistical nightmares that come with printing out reams of tests, assessment software has become a focus for school districts. Assessment software is simple, as it is only designed to deliver tests or quizzes, record answers and score the result. Assessment software is also in widespread use among teachers, as it is a low effort way to track student grades over the course of a school year.

Because assessment software is simple in principle, there are many open-source and free options available to educators, so this isn’t an area where heavy investment is usually needed.

3. Reference software – Reference software has gone completely online, and there are few examples of school districts still using proprietary pieces of software for reference purposes. This marks an extremely rapid change, as school computers were loaded up with dictionary and encyclopedia software as recent as the early 2000s. That’s no longer the case, as sites like Wikipedia have made such software obsolete. And in addition to general research sites like Wikipedia, Google Scholar and Lexis, most medical and science journals now publish online. The web offers a far greater compendium of knowledge than any one piece of reference software could match.

4. Classroom aids – The market for classroom aid technology and software has exploded in recent years, and represents one of the most promising approaches to the classroom of the future.

Classroom aids include impressive audio and visual technology, blending the best of A/V and courseware to create a much more engaging sum. Classroom aids started with well-worn and increasingly archaic technology like the overhead projector, and soon developed into improved digital displays and eventually interactive projectors and whiteboards.

Interactive whiteboards are the current standard in classroom aid technology, and have enjoyed enormously high adoption rates in Europe. The U.S. is quickly catching up, though, and the trend is only accelerating. There are a few interactive whiteboard models on the market, but only the SMARTBoard and Clevertouch are ideal for educational purposes.

The Clevertouch is a fine example of what interactive whiteboards can do in the classroom. Each one comes with an intuitive interface (called LUX) that is modeled after the interface found on Android devices. Students, therefore, are quick studies when it comes to the Clevertouch. With the Clevertouch, teachers can build lessons using graphic and media assets, reducing lesson creation time greatly. Teachers can also model math and physics principles using Clevermaths and turn the Clevertouch into a multi-zone lesson delivery device with Snowflake. This, along with the Clevertouch’s extensive device connectivity capabilities, allows for true multi-user collaboration between students.

And classroom aid technology comes with proprietary software designed to improve the technology’s function. Again, the Clevertouch is a strong example of how this merge of hardware and software can pay massive dividends for educators. Through the Clevertouch, educators can access the Cleverstore, which isn’t so much a store as it is a massive bank of educational applications. All in-app purchases have been removed and all content unlocked, so the Clevertouch can be augmented in a major way with smart use of the Cleverstore.
