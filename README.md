# Educational Technology Plan

{Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan}

This Educational Technology Plan is prepared to ensure that Santa Teresa High School will know what the minimum technical requirements are for the APCS-Principles class.

## Context

### Course  APCS-Principles

{Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level}

Grade: 9 - 12

"AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical." -- CollegeBoard

### Situation

{Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?}

Santa Teresa High School is one of eleven high schools in the Eastside Union High School District.  In 2013, we started teaching Exploring CS.  In 2015, we added APCS-A (Java).  We did not participate in APCS-P in 2017 when it first came out, and we started teaching APCS-P in 2018.

CS has become popular in our school, and at the moment, we have eight CS classes.  We currently has only one computer lab, and the other three classes are taught in the library's computer lab, which is not a proper classroom.  With its growth rate, within the next two years, we will have ten CS classes.  This calls for having two computer labs.  This means more hardware (computers, Android devices), software licenses, and more demand from the network for efficient Internet speed.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

{Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.}

1. Courseware

   We use mobile-CSP, and the courseware is supplied in Runestone.

   The student version is in https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp.

   The teacher version is in https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/teach-mobilecsp

   mobile-CSP uses MIT's App Inventor.  This is an app totally run on the web.  We use this for our coding exercises.

2. Assessment software

Our district provides us with IlluminteEd.
I sometimes use Kahoot just to have some fun.

3. Reference software

There are many sites with free APCS-P software which we can use as reference:

code.org
projectSTEM

4.  Classroom aids 

Google Classroom



The Clevertouch is a fine example of what interactive whiteboards can do in the classroom. Each one comes with an intuitive interface (called LUX) that is modeled after the interface found on Android devices. Students, therefore, are quick studies when it comes to the Clevertouch. With the Clevertouch, teachers can build lessons using graphic and media assets, reducing lesson creation time greatly. Teachers can also model math and physics principles using Clevermaths and turn the Clevertouch into a multi-zone lesson delivery device with Snowflake. This, along with the Clevertouch’s extensive device connectivity capabilities, allows for true multi-user collaboration between students.

And classroom aid technology comes with proprietary software designed to improve the technology’s function. Again, the Clevertouch is a strong example of how this merge of hardware and software can pay massive dividends for educators. Through the Clevertouch, educators can access the Cleverstore, which isn’t so much a store as it is a massive bank of educational applications. All in-app purchases have been removed and all content unlocked, so the Clevertouch can be augmented in a major way with smart use of the Cleverstore.



### Hardware Specifications

{Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.}

While I understand that chromebooks are probably good enough for the purpose of running this course, I would like to recommend PC laptops.

Why PC?


Android device

7" 8 GB Android 4.4, GPS, Accelerometer, Rear Camera
Interactive whiteboards are the current standard in classroom aid technology, and have enjoyed enormously high adoption rates in Europe. The U.S. is quickly catching up, though, and the trend is only accelerating. There are a few interactive whiteboard models on the market, but only the SMARTBoard and Clevertouch are ideal for educational purposes.

###  Network Specifications

{Describe network and communication devices/infrastructure involved in your plan.}

The computers need gigabit ethernet connectivity and the Android devices need wireless connectivity.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
