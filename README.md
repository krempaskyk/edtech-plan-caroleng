# Educational Technology Plan

{Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan}

This Educational Technology Plan is prepared to ensure that Santa Teresa High School will know what the minimum technical requirements are for the APCS-Principles class.

## Context

### Course  APCS-Principles

{Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level}

Grade: 9 - 12

"AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical." -- College Board

### Situation

{Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?}

{In addition to describing the course, provide pertinant details about the situation in which you will be teaching it. If you know information like class size, student demographics, classroom/school technologies available, etc., summarize it here. If you are not yet a teacher or want to keep the plan broad to potentially adopt in different situations, provide a summary of the assumptions you are making, such as approximate class size, grade levels, and technology available.}

Santa Teresa High School is one of eleven high schools in the Eastside Union High School District.  In 2013, we started teaching Exploring CS.  In 2015, we added APCS-A (Java).  We did not participate in APCS-P in 2017 when it first came out, and we started teaching APCS-P in 2018.

CS has become popular in our school, and at the moment, we have eight CS classes.  We currently has only one computer lab, and the other three classes are taught in the library's computer lab, which is not a proper classroom.  With its growth rate, within the next two years, we will have ten CS classes.  This calls for having two computer labs.  This means more hardware (computers, Android devices), software licenses, and more demand from the network for efficient Internet speed.

## Plan

{In the plan, you will specify what technologies both you and your students will use.}

### Software Specifications

{Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.}

{Within the Software subsection, describe all software you (and your students) will use including operating system(s), learning management systems, required installed software, as well as any online/web services. For example, for this class, I would list a variety of operating systems (including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux), Blackboard LMS, GitHub.com, and the video recording/editing software I use (OBS and iMovie).}

1. Courseware

   We use mobile-CSP, and the courseware is supplied in Runestone.

   The student version is in https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp.

   The teacher version is in https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/teach-mobilecsp

   mobile-CSP uses MIT's App Inventor (IDE).  This is an app totally run on the web.  We use this for our coding exercises.

2. Assessment software

   Our district provides us with IlluminteEd.

   I sometimes use Kahoot just to have some fun.

3. Reference software

    There are many sites with free APCS-P software which we can use as reference:

    - Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)
    - Code.org
    - CodeAcademy
    - CodeHS
    - CSAwesome
    - projectSTEM.org

4.  Classroom aids 

    - Google Classroom
    - Jamboard (electronic whiteboard)
    - SchoolLoop (teacher grading system)
    - Naviance (official district grade reporting system)
    - Google G suite
    - Microsoft Office

### Hardware Specifications

{Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.}

{Also describe if/how they are network connected (i.e. ethernet vs wifi, along with any known limitations like blocked WWW access). Describe any other relevant technology as well, such as projectors, smart boards, etc.}

1.  Course

    While I understand that chromebooks are probably good enough for the purpose of running this course, I would like to recommend PC laptops.  I am hoping that my students will be doing more challenging projects that require the power of a "real" PC.  The minimum requirements will be:
    - Intel i7 processor
    - 16 GB RAM 
    - 64-bit operating system
    - Windows 10 
    - **no** touch type (less finger prints on the screen)

    Android device (phone or tablet) with minimum requirements:
    - 4 GB RAM
    - 8 GB storge
    - Android operating system
    - GPS
    - Accelerometer
    - Camera

    Why **Android**?  We use mobilecsp, which uses App Inventor to write apps.  The MIT's team has tried to make App Inventor works for both Android and iOS.  The Android OS has beework with Apple to make App Inventor works for iOS, but every time when Apple update the iOS version, App Inventor will stop working.

    The teacher's laptop and Android device requirements are the same as the students'.
    
2. Classroom Aid

    An overhead projector in the classroom is a must.  Teachers need to show students what to do, and students need to be able to see the projection no matter where they sit.

###  Network Specifications

{Describe network and communication devices/infrastructure involved in your plan.}

The computers need gigabit ethernet connectivity and wireless connectivity.

The Android devices need wireless connectivity.  The phone should be unlocked because we do not need the phone to connect to the phone network.

It is a requirement that the computer and the Android device must run on the same wifi network.  So it is important that the school allows students to log on to the wifi network.

Why bother with **ethernet**?  Well, we seem to have bad Internet connection.  When that happens, students can still be connected via ethernet and get other work done.

### Application

{Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.}

{After listing the technical details of the plan, you will explain how you will use the technology in the Application subsection. For example, in a programming course, you will explain that students will use their IDE (which should be listed in the software) to code and run their programs but you will also describe how they will turn in the assignments and how you will grade them and give students feedback. This is also where you will describe any of the evidence-based practices you plan to adopt and how technology will support them (e.g. describing how you will apply the coherence principle to designing PowerPoint presentation slides that will be projected for lessons, and how students will share their computers to practice pair programming), as discussed in the modules on eLearning Principles and Computing Practices & Pedagogy.}

1.  Learning in class

    Teacher will teach using App Inventor, PowerPoints, Videos, or Jamboard eleWhiteboard via the overhead projector.
    
2.  Doing Class Work
    
    Students will use App Inventor to write their apps, and will use Google Doc or Microsoft Word to do their reflections or App write-up.
 
3.  Collaboration and Communication

    Students will use Google G suite to collaborate -- they can share Google Doc or Slides.
    
    Students will communicate with teachers using email.
    
4.  Turning in Homework
    
    Students can turn in their homework in Google Classroom.  Teacher will grade assignments from Google Classroom, and then export grades to School Loop.
    
5.  Assessments 

    For quizzes, tests, and final exam, we will use IlluminateEd to create the assessments, and then students can go there to do the assessments, and multiple choice questions will be automatically graded.  IlluminateEd is not the best software for entering test questions, it is very tedious; but this is the only testing software that we have.
    
    Sometimes I use Kahoot to give students quick tests.  The competition creates some fun.
    
6.  Assessments -- Performance Tasks

    Performance Tasks will have to be done using App Inventor to create the program, and then Google Doc or Microsoft Word to answer the prompts from College Board.
 
7.  Checking Grades

    Students can check their grades in SchoolLoop or Naviance (offical posted grades).

### Impacts

{How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.}

{Finally, in the final version, you will discuss the Impacts of your plan. Here, you can justify your choices in how you expect it to help students' learning. Explain how you have catered your plan to your course and context. This is also where you can describe any contigency plans you have, such as if you have to transition to  from in-person to virtually teaching.}

There is a high demand in Computer Science (CS) jobs now and possibly for the next many years.  However, it is difficult to convince students to do Computer Science because many students view CS as a difficult subject, and they don't want to even try it.  This particular happens to underserved students.  Every year, I go to the parent groups of underserved students to sell the CS programs.  I usually manage to convince a few students to try.

This Educational Technical plan ensures that the class will go smoothly so students will not give up due to technical difficulty.  The underserved students will be the first ones to give up because when things don't go the correct way, they will think that it is their fault, ...  

#### APCS-Principles

I taught APCS-A before APCS-Principles exist.  Students only had Exploring CS, and then they did Java.  It requires a lot of hard work to catch up with the curriculum, and not many students can do it.  I really love APCS-Principles.  It sits between Exploring CS and APCS-A.  APCS-Principles deals with the algorithm and abstraction, so it saves teachers time to teach these concepts in the Java class.  I found that most students did a lot matter if they had taken APCS-Principles before APCS-A.  So this class is going to give students confidence in coding.

#### Coming Back from Distance Learning (DL)

Some students are not coping well coming back from DL.  They found it hard to adjust to the In-Person (IP) schedule.  They were still playing games at home, so homework never got done.  Not to mention that they were not learning as much as they could while DLing.  All these just became too much for students, and many had declared having anxiety or mental health problems.

Our Educational Technical plan will reduce their stress of having to deal with technical problems.

#### Going Back to Distance Learning

I we ever have to go back to DL, students will not have the luxury of working on a PC, unless they personally have one.  The district had allowed for one Chromebook per student.  It really is not satisfactory, but since Santa Teresa is not a Title I school, we do not have the funding to buy all CS students (250) a PC laptop.  The good news is that the class can still go on even though it is not ideal.

####  Expanding too Fast

As mentioned before, we really should build another computer lab.  That would be something that admin should budget for soon.
